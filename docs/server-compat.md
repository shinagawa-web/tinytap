# Server Compatibility

> Part of v0.4.0 (#37). Manual exploration — each row is filled in by running tinytap against a real server and observing the captured traffic.

## How to read this table

**Syscall** — the syscall(s) the server uses to send the HTTP response body. Determines whether tinytap can see the body at all.

**Body visibility** — what the TUI shows for each body size:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Full body visible |
| ⚠️ | Visible but truncated at the 256 B BPF cap (#36) |
| ❌ | Not captured (sendfile / splice path — body bypasses the BPF probe) |
| — | Not yet tested |

**Body sizes used in each run:**

| Label | Size | Rationale |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Small | < 256 B | Fits within the BPF sample cap — the "everything visible" baseline |
| Medium | ~1 KiB | Exceeds the cap; tests truncation |
| Large | ~50 KiB | Forces the server to issue multiple write calls or use sendfile |

## Compatibility table

| Server | Issue | Syscall | Small | Medium | Large | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| Python `http.server` | #41 | — | — | — | — | |
| Go `net/http` | #42 | — | — | — | — | |
| Node.js `http.createServer` | #43 | — | — | — | — | |
| nginx (static + proxy) | #44 | — | — | — | — | sendfile expected for static files |
| Caddy | #45 | — | — | — | — | |
| Bun.serve | #46 | — | — | — | — | optional |
| Uvicorn (ASGI) | #102 | — | — | — | — | asyncio / libuv |
| Gunicorn (WSGI) | #103 | — | — | — | — | sync worker baseline |
| Axum (Rust / hyper) | #104 | — | — | — | — | writev expected |

## Cross-server summary

> To be written once #41–#44 are complete.

## Notes for #36 (lifting the 256 B BPF cap)

> Collect per-server surprises (TCP_CORK, MSG_MORE, kernel buffering, sendfile gaps) here once the rows are filled in.

## Reusable test fixtures

> Script and body-size files go here so #29 can wrap them with assertions.
